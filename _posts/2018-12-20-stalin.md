title: Lessons in negotiation from Stalin at Yalta & Potsdam
author: Abe Winter
description: Why did you sting me? You'll drown too

I'm reading [The Berlin Airlift](https://www.worldcat.org/search?q=isbn%3A178578255X) to learn about postwar Europe and operational excellence. Unexpected bonus: a master-class in negotiating tactics from none other than Josef Vissarionovich a.k.a. Stalin.

History showed Stalin was a bad dude but Roosevelt arrived with an open mind; the American-British relationship was strained by lend-lease, the tremendous cost of the war to both parties, and each leader's belief that the other wasn't pulling his weight.

Churchill, as a shrewd reader and writer of history, had no illusions about Stalin, but he was tired. He and Roosevelt couldn't present a united front.

These meetings fascinate me because my career increasingly depends on winning arguments. All these tactics have been used, on a lesser scale, against me. Imagining Stalin across the table will help me to stick to my guns in hard arguments, and to navigate the difference between a partner who can get to win-win and an adversary who will break their word.

## Your counterparty should be down points before you start

If at all possible, meet with the old & sick and force them to travel to Ukraine to talk to you.

At Potsdam Truman was inexperienced and Churchill lost his office mid-way and was replaced.

## Use your power to control the agenda

Know why the other person has deigned to come to the table and beat them over the head with it. In this case it's that Russia was an important ally and, if not appeased, would be a dangerous enemy.

Use these underlying power dynamics to control the agenda -- you'll get more mileage fighting to avoid talking about a topic vs fighting the topic out point by point.

If you're on the receiving end of this, the best you can do is agree on topics beforehand. If you don't know the issues well enough to map them out, try adopting a deliberative rule set like Robert's Rules of Order which provides for adding to the agenda.

## Don't lose momentum of action when you sit down

Strive to be the party who benefits from delay. Stalin got this by continuing to implement his plans while negotiations went on.

In Germany, his troops were dismantling factories and shipping them back to Russia. Apparently they had no luck reassembling them but the loss of productive capacity contributed to the slow recovery of occupied Germany's economy.

Across Europe, Soviet agents were infiltrating parties and influencing elections.

## Be inconsistent

Create high level objections that are predicated on fairness and then fight tooth and nail against the details of an equitable division. Stalin demanded punishing reparations from Germany and then stripped all wealth & industry from the Soviet districts.

The postwar economy of Germany was structured in a way that required the Allies to pay in money and goods and shipped some large fraction of that back out the door to Russia.

Stalin also had the ability to play good cop bad cop with Molotov, his foreign minister. Stalin could chat amiably with Roosevelt to win his friend while Molotov yelled and screamed to get the agenda they wanted. Untangling this takes energy.

I've only been successful against inconsistency when I came in with a mastery of the details. Even a fair counterparty will take you for a ride if you rely on them for any information. Do your homework.

## Implementation is half the battle

The Soviets fought tooth and nail to limit the number of routes by which the Allies could access Berlin, and then would arbitrarily refuse free access to even those routes.

If you can't remove an onerous term from the deal, invent reasons to fight against terms that will permit your counterparty to monitor or enforce the term.

Even when you're negotiating with a fair counterparty, shit happens. Responsible negotiators condition consideration on performance.

## Be the agent of chaos

Stalin thought the capitalist nations would turn on each other within a decade and the winner would attack Russia. The division of Europe was a temporary measure to let the Soviets recharge their arms & population and prepare for the big one, but he was more eager for a fight than anyone else at the table.

If you've ever been an A student in a group project with a C student (or vice versa), you know how to play this game. Another take is [the scorpion and the frog](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgSxeITKxyw) -- be prepared to play your hand even when it's not rational, and a rational counterparty may be caught be surprise.

If your counterparty has a much higher tolerance for chaos than you, you should find out where their real priorities and cares lie and move the negotiation there. For Stalin, it was probably his own power first and second providing a shield of client countries between him and the capitalist west.

## Defense against the dark arts

Most of these tactics aren't great in the long term because successful negotiations yield their value in repeat business, and that requires trust. Nobody wants to sit down with Stalin twice. Eventually the western nations stopped dealing with him.

That said:

* Just because you want to play fair doesn't mean you should give your power away
* We need to understand this stuff so we don't fall victim to it

Sometimes the solution is as easy as naming the bad tactic, saying how it compromises your interests, and asking to ban it going forward. Other times you have to identify a bad deal or bad counterparty and walk the F away.
