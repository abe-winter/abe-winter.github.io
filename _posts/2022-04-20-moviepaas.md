I never had moviepass.
(You'd have to pay me my hourly consulting rate to sit through a 60-minute movie).
I'm told the hobbit movie is 8 hours long and doesn't feature tom bombadil[^oldtom]. This surpasses understanding.

[^oldtom]: [oldest and fatherless](https://km-515.livejournal.com/1042.html) his terrible secret

Did moviepass defraud investors?
Investors say yes[^moviepass].
I've heard anecdotally that management wanted to launch a more sustainable, less-subsidized service and one of their investors was like 'no, go big', which is to say the board was complicit. I'm not sure which narrative is right. 

[^moviepass]: [MoviePass Parent Company Sued by Shareholders as It Continues to Bleed Money](https://www.thewrap.com/moviepass-parent-company-sued-shareholders-continues-bleed-money/). "Defendants carried out a plan, scheme and course of conduct which was intended to, and did, deceive the investing public and cause the plaintiff and other members of the class to purchase" etc

Did netflix + uber defraud investors by creating really nice consumer experiences, and cushy offices where developers get paid to work on resume-builder OSS projects[^oss-startups], while unit economics were eternally and hopelessly negative?

[^oss-startups]: matt turck [vc pullback](https://mattturck.com/vcpullback/) letter talks about netflix employees ditching to run their OSS projects as companies. netflix doesn't own a piece of the action. ctrl-F for 'open source projects'

This post is about netflix + uber imploding, and whether that's bad.

## why fraud when you can gaap

Fraud of course has multiple elements and one of them is 'did the alleged fraudster *know* they were lying'.
My take: probably not at first?
uber launched as a competitor to black cars, not taxis. netflix mailed people DVDs.
Over time they developed these businesses into frictionless, but also moatless, models[^moatless], and got cloned by companies who could operate them more cheaply.

[^moatless]: [7 powers guy on acquired pod](https://www.acquired.fm/episodes/7-powers-with-hamilton-helmer). business author who writes about competition thinks uber doesn't have a moat. Find the 'network effects' paragraph that talks about 'meaningful profitability'. IMO this is a right take on uber + all gig businesses -- creating a gig labor force is hard, stealing one that has already been created is easy. The whole point of gig labor is low barrier to entry and part-time-ness. Exclusivity is anathema.

Another element of fraud is 'did the victim *not* know it was a lie', were they actually fooled.
This one is harder because there have been voices saying 'if you do your diligence, it's obvious that these aren't working'.
Hubert Horan is years into a series of articles where he personally adjusts uber's gaap down[^hubert] when they do an earnings statement.

[^hubert]: [part 29 in a series](https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2022/02/hubert-horan-can-uber-ever-deliver-part-twenty-nine-despite-massive-price-increases-uber-losses-top-31-billion.html) by hubert horan, 40 yrs experience. he thinks uber overstated profit by 3.2b in 2021 and has lost a total of 30 billion dollars over the lifetime of their company. I'm not an accountant and don't know how to extract data tables from PDFs and am not endorsing this view

When wework's S-1 came out, beyond the nutty softbank battle about whether to IPO + what price, they were panned for some bananas accounting term that they made up[^ebitda].

netflix depreciates their content on a varying calendar; originals mostly 4 years, chelsea handler right away[^content].
Perhaps 4 years is justified by real subscriber behavior. If not, netflix is in the same business as moviepass; borrowing money to buy content at retail prices, then sell at a discount.

The effect of content on retention is probably mediated by whether competing streaming services are also adding good content.
Their competition, btw, is amazon, which uses free videos to sell scammy prime[^stoller], and apple, which has more cash than god *and* which kept 30% of netflix's itunes revenue until 2018[^apple-netflix].
Choose your fighter.

[^apple-netflix]: [netflix stopped accepting itunes](https://venturebeat.com/2018/12/28/netflix-permanently-pulls-itunes-billing-for-new-users/) in dec 2018 per venturebeat

[^content]: [netflix content accounting](https://www.fool.com/investing/2017/07/19/how-netflix-accounts-for-all-of-its-content-spendi.aspx), motley fool, Adam Levy (2017). It links to this 2016 article saying [espn spends more on content than anyone else](https://www.fool.com/investing/2016/10/27/espn-spends-more-on-content-than-anyone-else-inclu.aspx), which I suspect is no longer true, but is relevant in that cable subsidizes the cost of espn; by quietly drawing from a pool that is larger than their actual users, espn probably increased the price of sports licenses above the true demand. More recent [2021 netflix IR deck](https://s22.q4cdn.com/959853165/files/doc_downloads/2020/01/IR-Content-Accounting-Slides-Jan-2020.pdf) on content accounting talks about ASC 920, a GAAP 'accounting standards codification' on how to account for digital content, and says 4 years is still their average amortization.

## bread, games and involution

When things are artifically cheap I think of 'panem et circenses', a contemporary critique by a poet[^poets] of the politicization of ancient Rome's grain dole, named 'annona' after the roman goddess of corn and, I shit you not, the grain supply.
Her symbols were a cornucopia and a boat.

[^poets]: bjork taught me that [you shouldn't trust poets](https://youtu.be/75WFTHpOw8Y?t=129) and you should seek the true and scientifical explanation, which is much better

Subsidies, like 'community EBITDA', are an accounting hack, and can ruin your IPO or worse.
The Romain grain subsidies were a factor in the end of the republic and the birth of the empire.
Later, in the 200s AD, they caused a currency crisis, which was resolved by Diocletian's price controls but not before the empire split in half.

(FWIW I'm *not* saying societies in 2022 shouldn't feed everyone; unlike the Romans, grain isn't our whole economy).

Subsidies are politically weird, or *get* weird if they don't start out that way.
Tacitus wrote that the lower classes had no public interest save the grain supply.
The dole was initially for laborers and slaves, aka non-citizens who lacked steady income.[^gracchi]
(Ironic, isn't it, that they structured their system to remove a group from political life, and the economic needs of that group ended up blowing up the system).

[^gracchi]: [The Gracchi and the Era of Grain Reform](https://scholarworks.harding.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1034&context=tenor)

Caesar as consul changed it from cheap to free[^caesar], a bribe to the people which enabled him to become dictator.
I lost the cite for this (firefox crashed), but the full subsidies warped the local economy such that local farmers shut down their farms, moving to the city to receive the dole.
'We're too rich to make things here' is a bad definition of 'rich'.

[^caesar]: [Frumentariae Leges](https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/SMIGRA*/Frumentariae_Leges.html), dictionary of greek and roman antiquities, william smith, 1875

Rome got into this mess because of a side effect of urbanization: city dwellers are located far from their supply chain.
Plus other large capitals back then were nearish their grain supply[^gracchi], while Rome relied on shipping.
Once the annona was in place, Rome's subsequent population growth was built on top of it;
the larger the population, the larger the disaster of removing it, and the larger the military network required to send home grain.

I'm not a china watcher but I read something[^involution] about 'involution', an econ term describing the intensification of labor without increasing wealth.
Online people have adopted it to describe 2020s china.
I wonder if it applies to bread-and-games era Rome as well -- more and more labor being tasked with securing the grain supply, without new innovations that increase the yield[^yield].
I wonder if netflix and uber are in an involution spiral, growth depending on more intensive 'farming' of investors, contractors, employees, and customers.

[^involution]: [involution (nèijuǎn) on chinese social media](https://www.whatsonweibo.com/the-concept-of-involution-neijuan-on-chinese-social-media/), whatsonweibo, Manya Koetse

[^yield]: In fairness Casson's 'Ancient Mariners' says they at least got better at shipping it

I'm not saying the millennial lifestyle subsidy[^mls] will end our republic. I'm not saying shortages in long-distance supply chains are the same problem in 2022 as for Tertullus in 359 (who had to promise to starve his kids if storms destroyed the grain ships).
I'm not saying that WSB / gamestop are signs of decay.
I'm not saying that our class structure is as broken as the city of Rome, or that Rome's was broken for its era, or that removing voting sites in poor districts in the US is equivalent to Rome's non-citizen class.

I'm not qualified to say these things. But I'm *thinking* them.

[^mls]: there's a new york times article called 'farewell millennial lifestyle subsidy' which I can't look up bc I have too many tabs open and the NYT paywall code sometimes crashes firefox

A less crazy take here is that we should, as a society, ask participants in the public markets to issue accurate accounting.
Arthur Andersen *was* a big 5 accounting firm, so it's not like this stuff is zero consequence, but let's normalize good accounting.

In the case of uber and netflix, 'collapse' so far has meant increasing prices, or squeezing driver margins, because investor money isn't as infinite as state coffers.
Maybe this is how bubbles pop, and private money has a working safety valve, and the system isn't doomed?

## can we have nice things without defrauding investors?

It's hard.
Even if some hypothetical bootstrapped investor wanted to start a company with sane cost controls and straightforward accounting, the moment their model is validated, it's open season for the VC backed firms to 'growth hack', aka sell the same thing at a lower price.
We're somehow okay with companies giving stuff away to induce subscriptions, even though we're not okay with elected officials giving things away to become dictators.

And money is, in a way, information, and in areas where we don't have much information money naturally becomes inefficient.

But this is probably a governance problem.
I don't know the answer (as usual), and I don't even think I know the answer (less common).
We need to agree there's a tragedy of the commons, and then define it well enough to regulate.
Maybe you're not allowed to operate a money-losing business? But that's tricky too -- R&D is money-losing, until it isn't.

And governance can be hacked:
health care in the US is one large accounting problem, is heavily regulated, but the industry has become sentient faster than the regulators and is resisting our attempts to kill it.
And like grain in Rome, health *is* a large % of our GDP.

Random example from a month ago: HR 6833 ('affordable insulin now' act) lowers prices to consumers without changing the price paid to suppliers.
Someone in the floor debate cited an axios article saying this just shifts costs to employers and insurers, ultimately increasing premiums[^shifts], i.e. the bill is an accounting scam.
This is just a random example; every health interaction I've had has had some kind of accounting irregularity.

[^shifts]: [AFFORDABLE INSULIN NOW ACT; Congressional Record Vol. 168, No. 57](https://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2022/03/31/house-section/article/H4033-1)

Health care providers have engaged in regulatory capture such that the rules seem to protect the system in its current form.
(And rules that can reform the system, like medicare's price transparency change, are ignored[^price-t]).
Tons of public money is being diverted to maintain it, as well as pseudo-public money like pre-tax employer coverage.
And simultaneously, various players in the system are getting squeezed.

[^price-t]: price transparency rules: 14% compliance says [gothamist in 2022](https://gothamist.com/news/nyc-hospitals-still-arent-sharing-all-their-prices-a-year-after-transparency-law-took-effect), 17% said [axios in 2021](https://www.axios.com/hospitals-price-transparency-costs-regulations-noncompliance-ebf6bd21-5709-4298-b67a-74c8a90a1ec1.html). Not sure if it's going down or just different survey methodology

netflix, uber, and the health care system are all markets that have been parasitized by weird unnecessary intermediaries.
Maybe we ban subscriptions and force platforms to sell things one by one.
Maybe we 'make markets markets', restricting the role of platform-like creatures who don't seem to add value.
(Though parasites play a role in predator-prey dynamics[^parasites] and potentially increase the malthusian fitness of the system? And parasites in theory defend against worse parasites).

[^parasites]: [dynamics of predation](https://www.nature.com/scitable/knowledge/library/dynamics-of-predation-13229468/), Alyson Stevens, 'host-parasite interactions' section.

But more rules haven't solved the problem so far.

Maybe new values would?
But public values are almost religions. Is there a viable religion of 'don't buy cheap stuff'?
What commandments are violated by the millennial lifestyle subsidy?

What myths would remind us to fear Danaans, even those bearing gifts.
