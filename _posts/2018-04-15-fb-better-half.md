title: FB is only sharing *half* of what they know about me

FB, as an olive branch to privacy nuts, is sharing with users the stuff they collect directly. Some other cloud companies do this too. <img src="https://anti.style/flatpixel/fb-better-half">

But that's not all they have on us. They use this directly collected data to cross-reference me and further categorize me.

# So please also share:

* what they inferred about me by matching third party databases or running internal models; where each piece came from
* why each ad was shown (i.e. the real impact of categorization)
* who paid for each ad & how much
* what AB tests / user experiments the ran on me
* what information they sold or gave away, and to whom
* which employees accessed which pieces of my data and why (anonymize to job title to be safe)

# Congress has an in here

I'm not saying FB has a legal obligation to share this (I'm not saying they don't -- I'm not a lawyer, I have no idea).

Not sure whether congress was cowed by MZ or is just still thinking about legislation, but privacy is an issue that has bipartisan support and requiring more disclosures can give government a level without regulating actual behavior

# This might be good for FB

Do they really want to fight an endless war of attrition with an increasingly privacy-conscious userbase? Let's just be transparent with each other.
