Like everyone else, I've gotten into [trust & community structure online](https://github.com/abe-winter/trustgator) so when someone sent me the Bumble [community guidelines](https://bumble.com/en-us/guidelines) ([archived here](https://web.archive.org/web/20190210140644/https://bumble.com/en-us/guidelines)) I dug in.

This document is probably unenforceable, it's internally incoherent, it undermines any contract Bumble executes with its users, and it ignores the lessons of history about discrimination. It offends me as a person who builds online products, as a person who's interested in the law (but [not a lawyer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IANAL)), and as a person period.

**Background**: Bumble is a dating app. Like Tinder, it's a Grindr clone (i.e. a proximity-based match app with swipe UX). They differentiate themselves from Tinder with a 'women swipe first' feature that has been the centerpiece of their (huge) saturation marketing campaign. I think this branding is supposed to stand for a general '[promise of safety with no guarantee](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/299834-flirting-is-a-promise-of-sexual-intercourse-without-a-guarantee)' approach to community trust design.

## Respect

> We're a very diverse community. This means you should respect other people's beliefs, interests and property while on Bumble. Bumble takes a strong stance against hate speech, rude or abusive behavior, bullying, and misogyny. You should behave the same way on Bumble as you would in real life. Additionally we encourage all of our users to report anyone who does not follow these behavioral guidelines. As a community rooted in kindness and respect, we expect all of our users to respect each other, themselves, and the Bumble staff.

A lot wrong here. First problem: this seems unenforceably vague. ['Respect' isn't defined](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbebjUYItKw). And even if it were, because the space of beliefs is large and not enumerated here, it's difficult to imagine a court allowing B to kick someone for not respecting, for example, Brony culture.

What's weirder is that this paragraph *lists* several things that could be called 'beliefs and interests': hate speech, bullying and misogyny. As part of my interest in trust online, I'm *interested* in hate speech & bullying. Misogyny is a *belief* that women are bad or less.

Taken at its literal meaning, this document is requiring Bumble users to respect hate speech, bullying and misogyny.

Another hole: the directive to behave on Bumble as I would in real life can defeat any other clause in this document. It doesn't even say 'as you *do* behave' -- it's 'would behave', as in 'would like to'. It's dealer's choice = total drivel.

The commandment to 'respect thyself' is icing on the crazy cake. This doesn't belong in a contract.

Am I twisting their words? Could be. But their words are twisting my brains. And I learned from watching suits that we must be precise, as the law is a precise endeavor. If you can't think straight you shouldn't charge people for drafting contracts.

## Guns and meat

From the doc:

<style>
blockquote { letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; }
</style>

> * No graphic hunting photos.
> * No guns.

These come at the end of a list of draconian photo requirements.

I'm a vegetarian. From my perspective, there's no difference between a photo of a dead animal and a photo of a steak. Or [grilling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H34QpoJsmrw) for that matter. I'm assuming Bumble is for adults, and I don't know anyone over 18 who doesn't understand where meat comes from.

But there's no law against eating meat, I can smell it everywhere I go, and any claim that vegetarians are offended by the sight of it can be flipped on its head; vegetarians offend some meat-eaters.

The 'no guns' line checks some more boxes. Arbitration case law is already wary of consumer contracts that waive the right to jury trials and that's only the [7th amendment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seventh_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution). This one implicates the second and the first. It breaks as many laws as it contains words. Is the right to carry a weapon in densely populated areas limited by state and local laws? Yes. But outside children's media (and this isn't that), there's no law against carrying one in a photo.

The bill of rights binds the state. Bumble is a private entity that shouldn't have to respect its users' rights, right? Right, unless you ask [the supreme court in 2017](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packingham_v._North_Carolina). Or [in 1946](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marsh_v_Alabama).

Also, there's a protected class that carries guns for work: veterans.

The veggie / meat thing may constitute religious discrimination. Vegetarianism, as a morally-based dietary practice, may meet the definition for a religion. Banning depictions of vegetarianism would injure Jains, some Buddhists, and I think Hindus? And because these issues are a two way street, banning all depiction of meat injures groups that use meat in their religious practice. (Which may even [include Christians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transubstantiation)). Hunting or animal slaughter is a religious practice for some groups.

Better filtering configs could be the compromise between showing all content and a blanket ban on guns / hunting. These apps already provide ways to 'not see' protected classes you don't want to see. Age is a good example -- [facebook is up the creek for age discrimination](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/5/31/17408884/facebook-amazon-job-ads-age-discrimination-lawsuit) but Bumble is probably allowed to. Filtering by religion is another special case on these apps that isn't permitted in the wider world.

I heard an interview about RBG's case [Craig v Boren](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_v._Boren) where she said that all equal rights issues are two-sided, and that defending young men's right to buy alcohol would end up helping women and all groups by creating a bedrock of equality in society. I like that argument and I feel that way about banning non-illegal 'activities that represent a group' on a widely used public forum. It would erode the bedrock.

## Diversity, speech and fences

> Before I built a wall I'd ask to know / What I was walling in or walling out,<br>
> And to whom I was like to give offense. / Something there is that doesn't love a wall,<br>
> That wants it down

Maybe Bumble is saying that gun rights and meat rights are different than rights of inclusion, or that the diversity that matters is inclusion for people that have a hard time being included. That argument is internally flawed because as soon as you exclude someone because they don't need help to be included, they suddenly *do* need that help.

Also concerning is that Bumble wants to achieve their diversity goal by restricting expression -- not just what you can say about other people's opinions but what you can put in a photo. I think you can defend diversity by allowing people to express themselves that attract the people they're looking to attract.

'Rude or abusive behavior' is scary. Etymonline tells me 'rude' means 'ill-mannered, uncultured; uneducated'. At best those things mean 'non-conforming'. At worst they mean 'non-elite'.

Nowhere does this document acknowledge that these lines are hard to draw, and that people from different backgrounds communicate with different words and images, and that arbitrating claims of offense will be difficult and require careful, fair standards (and ideally transparent ones).

Restrictions on speech have traditionally benefited the elite. English swearwords are saxon words for things that normans had their own words for, deemed impolite, and we're still not allowed to say them on TV. Winnie the Pooh, designed in 1966 to [torment XJP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winnie_the_Pooh_(Disney_character)#Use_in_political_satire_and_controversies_in_China) (then just 13 years old), has finally got his just deserts.

You can't defend diversity without defending speech, including speech you find distasteful. Diversity is what falls through the cracks in what you can stomach. It's not surprising that Bumble, an app whose core feature only serves heterosexual couples, can't wrap its DNA around this idea.

## Yoga ban = cheap policing

More draconian photo rules:

> * Face must be clearly visible in all photos.

This one is just perplexing. I get 'some' but why 'all'? Are they having issues with photo fraud?

Is the goal to make this easier for them to police? Designing fraud-resistant systems is important but there's a line where you're designing for cheapness of policing rather than user value.

Should we design societies for policing? I really hope the answer is no

More importantly -- if this is anything like instagram, there will be yoga pose photos on here sans visible face. If yes, are the yoga people going to move platforms? I *assume* B can't afford to lose them. And if they carve out an exception, that's a big due process problem for them to deal with. If yogis are allowed to do it the less hip users may deserve to as well.

## Enforcement bias

I doubt B has the resources to enforce this by machine. They could build a moderator farm, which is [unpopular](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/feb/26/facebook-moderators-tell-of-strict-scrutiny-and-ptsd-symptoms) and I doubt they can afford, or rely on user reports. Either way, if the people submitting complaints have any kind of unconscious cultural norms then their enforcement may be racist against everybody else.

Race, culture, and sexual orientation, combined with context, affect our communication, and I suspect these differences are more extreme when flirting. If you believe that regulating expression won't have outsized effects on diverse minorities, you're living under a rock.

## Contract and due process considerations

Is this community guidelines doc even a contract? Yes and no. (And I'm still not a lawyer).

On one hand, it's at times unenforceably vague. And it has vast optionality:

> If you don't follow these guidelines, you'll receive a warning (unless our team decides to block without warning at our discretion). If you ignore this warning, you risk losing your account

This isn't definite language: unless, discretion, risk. B can do whatever it wants and still comply with this vague promise. Optionality in terms of service [really screwed Zappos.com](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_re_Zappos.com,_Inc.,_Customer_Data_Security_Breach_Litigation) a while back.

Also, the doc doesn't clearly state consideration -- what do I get in exchange for following these policies. You might say 'implicitly, this is in exchange for using the site'. But people also pay money to use the site. One interpretation is that the money is for access to the site and this doc is a fun art project (I've certainly gotten hours of entertainment from it). I.e. not a contract.

*But* Bumble is going to use this someday as justification for kicking a user who has paid them money. And the money was in exchange for access to the service for a period of time, and implicitly for better matches, and implicitly for permanent access to those matches. So this dinky non-contract guidelines document is now tied to every dollar they've collected from kicked users (and potentially to people who matched with them).

Unclear rules + poorly-defined enforcement process + no appeal system = unfair = legal risk for the platform that behaves this way.

This kind of ambiguity gives me a hernia. Why can't people just write sane contracts?

There's also a really strange guarantee in there:

> We encourage our users to read profiles, learn about other people’s interests, and send an appropriate, relevant message to each match. We promise this will increase your chances of engaging in interesting conversations.

If this claim ever gets litigated I hope it's a [Bill Alsup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Haskell_Alsup) case. I love it when the law has to weigh in on statistical claims.

It would cost so little to get a serious expert in this area to create a policy that isn't nonsense, doesn't expose them to legal risk, and isn't offensive to anyone who cares about online speech. I can't believe how badly they've dropped the ball.

## Fair use

> We take copyrights very seriously. If you don't own the rights to a photo or video, please don't post it

Very seriously (winky face emoji).

What about fair use? What if I'm posing in public in front of a hung photo? What if I've paid someone to *license* a photo to which they 'own the rights' (licensing for cash being the whole point of copyright). Under the letter of this document, I can be kicked for that.

Have you *ever* gotten a takedown request? If not, why is this section even in the guidelines?

Even crazier: given the various selfie bans in this document we can assume most photos on the platform will be taken by someone other than the account owner. [Moral rights to a photo automatically assign to its author](https://photo.stackexchange.com/questions/25511/if-someone-makes-a-picture-of-me-who-owns-the-right-to-it). Under the letter of this doc, NO photo is safe.

Do I believe B intended this interpretation? Of course not.

I think their intent was something much worse: to police their platform with a psychotic policy document that hasn't been reviewed by a competent lawyer. [Google is openly evil now](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/google-dont-be-evil-code-conduct-removed-alphabet-a8361276.html) and even they wouldn't stoop this low.
