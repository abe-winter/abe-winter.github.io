If you've started a new programming job in the last few years and read your contract, you likely found something like this after the IP assignment block:

<style>
blockquote {font-style: normal; letter-spacing: normal;}
</style>

> Notwithstanding the foregoing, this section doesn't apply to work created by Employee on Employee's own time, without using company equipment, and not in any area of business in which Company is currently engaged or plans to engage.

Wisconsin and California amended their labor codes a while ago to require this language. Now even non-California companies are starting to have this, maybe because they use the same stock contract.

I get the 'area of business' piece (why pay an employee to develop competitive products) but the time & equipment terms upset me. Read on.

## Taking home a laptop isn't a perk

My industry doesn't have expensive tools. We have laptops. This has changed a little in the ML generation, where you might need expensive cloud resources to store data or train a model. Even with ML, you still do most work on a laptop.

These contracts seem to say that if I write anything on my work laptop, it belongs to my employer. And not just software -- these contracts sometimes list 'thoughts, feelings, dreams, ideas, whether or not reduced to practice'. (A lot of the crazier language here comes from Mattel v Bratz, a case where someone cloned Barbie and started a company around it. Plaintiff lost on a contract term).

So like a chump, I've always been diligent about doing side project work on my own laptop. I don't have my personal github logged in on my work laptop, I don't write this blog on my work laptop.

Here's why this is crazy: taking home a laptop isn't a perk. My apartment is an elephant graveyard of laptops, they're interchangeable. I carry my laptop everywhere. I whip it out at bars. I have a 'work phone' that I pay for that I tether to. I take my work laptop on vacation to hit deadlines and resolve emergencies.

In a case where I did original side work on a work laptop, it would be because I carried the thing around instead of my own.

I don't know whether or not there's case law on 'own laptop'. Could I have walked five minutes to the library and check out Westlaw? No -- I don't have any free time. (See next section).

## If it were my 'own time' I'd be sleeping

Ceding to my company my entire productivity between 9am and 5pm would thrill me because it would mean the rest of the time is *mine*. No 1am pager alerts, no backpack + laptop everywhere, no interrupting dinner, no more multitasking with after-hours slack to keep plans on the rails.

Here's the scariest interpretation: if I invent a solution to P=NP during a brain flash while I'm responding to an after-hours emergency, my employer owns the proof. The overnight page is clearly not my 'own time' because if it were my own time I would be sleeping. QED.

Does this matter in practice? I doubt (once again based on zero research) that 'own time' is the linchpin of any IP suit. I kind of doubt 'you developed it *during the day* while you worked for us' is an argument people really use (if I'm wrong here I'll get a bunch of hate mail from people who have lived through it).

If anything, this clause is a prod to keep people focused on their work during the workday, but motivating knowledge workers is complicated and I doubt a contract clause tips the scale.

Why should companies care about this? Because the habit of "don't pursue this now, it's not safe to innovate at work" isn't something you can turn on and off. Encouraging people to have good ideas and act on them, and making them feel ownership over those ideas, is probably not something you can split the difference on.

And it would be so great to be able to write things down during the workday instead of hoping I remember them later.

## Use this argument at your peril

In my opinion, 'own time' and 'own equipment' clauses are unconscionable for always-on-call laptop workers and shouldn't be enforceable in a contract. The 'area of business' piece should stand alone.

Like I said above, I don't know if company time / company laptop even comes up in lawsuits. I think Anthony Levandowski had some special deal with the W in Alphabet where he licensed them tech from his company, and they sued him anyway. But at the point where something is in front of [self-taught programmer Bill Alsup](https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/19/16503076/oracle-vs-google-judge-william-alsup-interview-waymo-uber) it has left the realm of my personal reality.

And I can't give legal advice.

That said, if you try this and it works, let me know.
