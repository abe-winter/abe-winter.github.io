I'm so sick of long crappy contracts. I've read more than two cloud services vendor contracts in the last month that grant them a bunch of rights to my IP and content including, in Facebook's case, an express right to compete with their partners.

For the entire month of July I'm going to reject these, in both consumer and business contexts.

Ground rules:

* Long = more than 500 words. ballpark it on mobile as 5 screens worth of scroll
* Anything with an arbitration clause or waiver of trial rights is verboten
* I'm cool with personal injury indemnity for dangerous things like axe throwing or trampoline basketball, as long as it doesn't excuse negligence
* Absolutely no rights or waivers that don't help the company provide the service I'm paying for
* For in-person contracts, I'll cross out the bad clauses and if there's no meeting of the minds, I'll walk away
* For digital EULAs, I'll send the company a request for a shorter, fairer contract and if they won't play ball, I'll send them a copy of this blog post
* Okay to sign whatever in an emergency (emergency travel, urgent medical care, need to start a new job or starve)

## Why

Companies are asking for stuff that has nothing to do with the thing I'm paying them for. In some cases we're talking about biggish deals of hundreds or thousands of dollars a month, so this isn't like some dinky freemium company that's trading services for likeness rights.

I don't want to do business with people who want to waive their duty of care. I'll pay up for legit services. I don't want to have to distinguish between 'we might injure you because our job is hard', 'we might injure you because we're incompetent', and 'we might injure you because they way we make money is by stealing things you thought were yours'.

I *do* want to exchange money for goods and services. If you want the same thing, I'd like to do business with you.

## How can this create change

1. Motivating me to discover good alternatives to the bad actors that I currently do business with
1. Sending feedback to companies with bad practices that people want better
1. If any companies agree to strike bad clauses (even for a price), I'll be driving in my small way the availability of good alternatives

There must be a market for being treated responsibly by people whom you pay with money. From 7/1 to 7/31 this year, I'll be a part of it. I hope it has two sides.
