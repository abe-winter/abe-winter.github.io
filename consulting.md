I work with scale-intensive companies who have big cloud bills, thin margins or systems that are failing under load.

If this sounds like you, drop me a line! I'm at awinter.public@gmail.com.

## Spend

I help companies reduce their cloud bill.
I can help you with:

* Vendor negotiation
* Cost modeling
* Rearchitecting and swapping in cheaper infrastructure
* Product changes to reduce peak load
* Autoscaling to reduce off-peak spend

## Scalability / peak capacity

I help companies cope with bursts of growth:

* Identifying and bulletproofing your unit of scaling, breaking up monoliths where necessary
* Vetting horizontal scaling and removing scaling bottlenecks
* Adding metrics where needed
* Caching

## Codebase velocity

Scaling can impose new costs on your team and slow down feature development.

I've helped companies:

* Improve system-scale tests to make releases safer. This means integration testing but also load testing where necessary
* Communicate better between frontend and backend teams, using tools and types
* Lower the risk of deployment with canaries and zero-downtime rollouts
