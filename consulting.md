I work with scale-intensive companies who have big cloud bills, thin margins or systems that are failing under load.

My background is in the New York tech ecosystem, where I've helped hyperscale companies survive their initial growth spurt and also worked at larger players.
I started my career doing quant work and low-level network performance for HFT finance.

## Spend

I help companies reduce their cloud bill.
The goal here can be reaching profitability or controlling your burn rate,
but if your annual spend is six figures or more, we should talk.

I can help you with:

* Vendor negotiation
* Cost modeling to identify which systems and features are costing money
* Architectural changes to reduce the load of your existing features or switch to cheaper infrastructure
* Product changes to reduce peak load
* Autoscaling to reduce off-peak spend

## Scaling / architecture

If you've just experienced a burst of growth or are preparing for one, there are parts of your system that aren't ready for load.

I've helped companies by:

* Tagging in on subsystems of your backend that fail under load
* Identifying and bulletproofing your unit of scaling, breaking up monoliths where necessary
* Adding caches or redesigning caches that are misbehaving

## Codebase velocity

Scaling can impose new costs on your tech team and slow down feature development.

I've helped companies:

* Improve system-scale tests to make releases safer. This means integration testing but also load testing where necessary.
* Communicate better between frontend and backend teams, using tools and types
* Deploy faster and more safely with CI, canaries and zero-downtime approaches
