Hi!

I used to be a platform and scalability programmer but in 2020 I'm building 4 products and doomscrolling a lot.

Among other qualifications, I've created over 150 situationally appropriate custom emoji, some of which are still in use today.

Need a speaker on SOA, cloud or realtime perf? Hit me up, it's awinter.public@gmail.com.
