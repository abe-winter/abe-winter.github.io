Mostly I'm trying to read more and the writing I do here gives me an excuse.

I'm also helping midsized web companies build backend stacks under load,
and also building [wait.chat](https://wait.chat), a hybrid inbox for async teams.

If you love or hate something that I've written here,
let me know on twitter or email.
If you want me to speak on your podcast / panel, I'm interested!

Few enough people read this blog that if you read + like it, I want to hear your thoughts.
Hit me up, it's awinter.public@gmail.com.
