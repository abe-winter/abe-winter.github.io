I write about the information economy and how the world is getting weird but not necessarily worse.
I also write about broken technology + institutions, and the intersection of the two.

I'm an armchair everything.

I also help midsized web companies tune their backend stack for load,
and am also building [wait.chat](https://wait.chat), a hybrid inbox for async teams.

Few enough people read this blog that if you have a reaction, I want to hear it.
Hit me up, it's awinter.public@gmail.com.
