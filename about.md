Mostly I'm trying to read more and the writing I do here gives me an excuse.

I'm also helping midsized web companies build backend stacks under load,
and also building a pre-launch consumer product.

If you love or hate something that I've written here,
let me know on twitter or email (scroll down).
Ideally all fan mail will include a book or article recommendation.

Few enough people read this blog. If you read + like it, I want to hear your thoughts.
Hit me up, it's awinter.public@gmail.com.
