Hi!

I used to be a platform and scalability programmer but in 2020 I'm building 4 products and doomscrolling a lot.

Among other qualifications, I've created over 150 situationally appropriate custom emoji, some of which are still in use today.

I'm trying to find a theme for this blog -- I think it's about the 'information economy', a term that I can't (yet) define but I know it touches on:

* networks of expertise
* law and norms including privacy
* non-money forms of wealth
* institutional interactions

Need a speaker on SOA, cloud or realtime perf? Hit me up, it's awinter.public@gmail.com.
