Greetings & welcome.

## Me / this blog

Mostly I'm trying to read more and the writing I do here gives me an excuse.

I'm also helping midsized web companies build backend stacks under load,
and also building a pre-launch consumer product.

If you love or hate something that I've written here,
let me know on twitter or email (scroll down).
Ideally all fan mail will include a book or article recommendation.

## My consultancy

You should hire me! I'm a scaling consultant which means that:

* if your app or website backend is failing with traffic
* or you need to lower your cloud bill
* or your systems are slowing down your developers

I can probably help.
Hit me up, it's awinter.public@gmail.com.
