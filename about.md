I write about the information economy and how the world is getting weird but not necessarily worse.
I also write about broken technology + institutions, and the intersection of the two.

In my IRL / WFH existence, I work on [KLERB](https://klerb.chat), a social IRL reading meetup app which you should try if you want to do a lot more socializing around books.

(I'm also an experienced software person + I help small companies with high traffic to adopt systems which scale).
