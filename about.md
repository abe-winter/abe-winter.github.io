Hi!

I used to be a scalability programmer but now I'm starting [cloudprogress.io](https://cloudprogress.io), a progress bar company.

Among my many qualifications you should know I've created over 150 situationally appropriate custom emoji, some of which are still in use today.

Opinions on this blog are mine not anybody else's (if I'm in trouble for misrepresenting a client) or belong to their original owners (if I'm in trouble for stealing).

Need someone to do public speaking in NYC on maintainability & performance of software in exchange for food or clothing? Hit me up, it's awinter.public@gmail.com.
