I write about the information economy and how the world is getting weird but not necessarily worse.
I also write about broken technology + institutions, and the intersection of the two.

In my IRL / WFH existence, I'm an experienced software person. I help small companies with high traffic to adopt systems which scale.

I'm also starting a thing which most people who have heard the pitch either don't understand or hate, so if you like to not understand / hate things, let's talk.

Random non-spam emails welcome, hit me up at awinter.public@gmail.com.
