Hi!

I used to be a scaling consultant but now I have a day job (and opinions on this blog are mine not my employer's).

Willing to do public speaking in NYC on maintainability & performance of software, preferably in exchange for food or clothing.

Hit me up at awinter.public@gmail.com for speaking engagements.
