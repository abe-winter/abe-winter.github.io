I write about the information economy and how the world is going to get very weird soon, but not necessarily worse.
I also write about broken technology + institutions, and the intersection of the two.

I also help midsized web companies tune their backend stack for load,
and am also building [wait.chat](https://wait.chat), a hybrid inbox for async teams.

If you love or hate something that I've written here,
let me know on twitter or email.
If you want me to speak on your podcast / panel, I'm interested!

Few enough people read this blog that if you read + like it, I want to hear your thoughts.
Hit me up, it's awinter.public@gmail.com.
