Greetings & welcome.

## This blog

Doesn't exactly have a theme, but I think it's about broken engineering management + the ever-unfolding 'information economy' (a term I cannot fully define).

## My consultancy

If the content here hasn't turned you off, you should hire me! I'm a scaling consultant which means that:

* if your app or website backend is failing with traffic
* or you need to lower your cloud bill
* or your developer processes are slowing down development

I can probably help. Hit me up, it's awinter.public@gmail.com.
