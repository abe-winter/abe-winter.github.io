I write about the information economy, broadly defined as the triangle of Vannevar Bush, Alvin Toffler, and Ralph Nader.
This lately includes a bunch of AI topics because the field is moving quickly.
I also write about broken technology + broken institutions, together and separately.

This blog is very seldom an expert source; I write to motivate my reading and [find out what I think](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2023/01/26/think-read/), not to diffuse knowledge to the public.
(I have relatively little knowledge and a relatively small public most days).

In my IRL / WFH existence, I work on [KLERB](https://klerb.chat), a social IRL reading meetup app which you should try if you want to do a lot more socializing around books.

(I'm also an experienced software person + I help small companies adapt to high traffic).
